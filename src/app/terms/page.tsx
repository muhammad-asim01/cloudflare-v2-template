            unless you are authorized on behalf of a third party and we agree
            that you may act on behalf of that third party. We may request that
            you provide written authorization from that third party confirming
            you have the necessary authority to transact tokens on their behalf.
            You will not use the Services in order to disguise the proceeds of,
            or to further, any breach of applicable laws or regulations, or to
            deal in any contraband tokens or proceeds. The price and liquidity
            of blockchain assets are extremely volatile and may fluctuate
            drastically. Price fluctuations in other digital assets can have a
            material and negative impact on tokens, which may also be subject to
            considerable price volatility.

            fraudulent or unintentional transactions may not be recoverable. Any
            transactions in the digital assets will be considered completed once
            they are registered on a public ledger, which may or may not be the
            same as the date or time you initiated the transaction. The value of
            tokens may be derived from market participants&rsquo; continued
            willingness to swap fiat currency or digital assets, which may
            result in the permanent and absolute loss of value of a specific

              losses, damages, or other issues relating to or arising out of the
              beta phase. While ChainGPT is dedicated to enhancing the
              performance and reliability of the launchpad, it cannot guarantee
              uninterrupted service or a completely error-free operation during
              this beta phase. The User&#39;s use of the launchpad constitutes
