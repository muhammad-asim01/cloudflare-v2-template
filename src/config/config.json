          },
          {
            "question": "What is an IDO?",
            "answer": "<p>IDO stands for Initial DEX Offering. It is a method of public fundraising that pools capital from retail users by utilizing a decentralized platform as the venue for facilitating the transactions. <br/><br/> This model is superior to the preceding ICO model because the platform can provide a higher degree of security for end users by collecting the funding and only releasing to the projects after the satisfaction of a certain criteria.</p>"
          },
          {
            "question": "What is CrowdFunding / Private Sale?",
            "answer": "<p>The crowdfunding/private sale is a very early round of fundraising that takes place right before an IDO.<br/><br/>Typically just a day or so before an IDO launch. These rounds tend to offer superior rates but also incur prolonged vesting periods.</p>"

            "question": "What is FCFS or First Comes First Serve round?",
            "answer": "<p>FCFS is the acronym for First-Come-First-Serve, and it refers to the round of fundraising that becomes available to the general public after the guaranteed round.<br/><br/>As the name might suggest, FCFS rounds are based on timing, available token supplies are sold to participants that arrive ahead of others.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Almost. Before being able to participate in the IDO’s users must do two more actions.<br/><br/>First, once $CGPT is acquired, users must make sure to have enough tier points for inclusion, if yes, then simply staking their tokens in the official <a href=\"https://www.degenpad.com/staking-pools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">Staking Dashboard</a><br/><br/>Second, they must pass KYC <a href=\"https://verify-with.blockpass.org/?clientId=degenpad_30b1f&serviceName=DegenPad&env=prod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">http://url.degenpad.com/kyc</a></p>"

          {
            "question": "Is there a refund policy?",
            "answer": "Yes. Every IDO launch will have a “refund grace period” lasting 7–14 days on average that allows participating users added time to evaluate their decisions before finalizing the commitments."

            "question": "Do I have to KYC in order to access the Launchpad?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. KYC is required for participating at any tier level. The KYC process has been made maximally simple through our partner Blockpass. To sign up please follow our official link: <a href=\"http://url.degenpad.com/kyc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">http://url.degenpad.com/kyc</a></p>"
          },
          {
            "question": "How is Pool Weight Calculated?",
            "answer": "<p>Pool weight is calculated based on the distribution of tier points among participating members and their corresponding tier levels.<br/><br/>Every pool has a structured base range that is dependent on their staking tier points.<br/><br/>Bronze | 1x | 2,000 points — 19,999 points Silver | 4x — 9.99x | 20,000 points — 49,999 points Gold | 10x — 39.99x | 50,000 points — 199,999 points Diamond | 40x + | 200,000 points +<br/><br/>The pool weight indicates how much multiplier is applied to that specific teir level’s allocation capacity.<br/><br/>Bronze maintains a base level of 1x multiplier throughout its entire point range. The Silver, Gold, and Diamond levels pool weights are scaled proportionally to the individual stakers point position within its range. To best understand the mechanism is through an empirical example:<br/><br/>In the event of a Silver tier with 20,000 points, they have a 4x multiplier. In the event of a Silver tier with 35,000 points, they have a 7x multiplier. In the event of a Silver tier with 49,999 points, they have a 9.99x multiplier.<br/><br/>This logic applies to the Gold tier equally.<br/><br/>Given that Diamond level can theoretically have no point limit, the cap on the multiplier for them is logarithmically relational to the total IDO’s upper bound.</p>"

          {
            "question": "What crypto tokens can be used to participate in IDOs?",
            "answer": "Stablecoins: USDT, USDC, BUSD\nCryptocurrencies: BNB, ETH"
          },
          {
            "question": "What countries are restricted from IDOs?",
            "answer": "<p>As of now, everyone can pass a KYC & sign up for ChainGPT Pad. However, countries that have banned cryptocurrencies will not be eligible to participate in IDOs.<br/><br/>Restricted countries: Bangladesh, China, Algeria, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Tunisia .<br/><br/>For a full list of sanctioned countries please refer to the directory provided by our KYC partner BlockPass:<a href=\"https://www.blockpass.org/major-sanctioned-countries-lists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.blockpass.org/major-sanctioned-countries-lists/</a></p>"

          {
            "question": "Can I stake into multiple Pools and still acquire points?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. If you wish to split up your $CGPT stake across different pools, then the Launchpad will calculate your point based on their individual placements.<br/><br/>As an example, if you stake 2,500 $CGPT into 45 day pool for 2,500 points and 2,500 $CGPT into the 180 day pool for 3,750 points then your associated wallet will be attributed the aggregated 6,250 tier points.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>The entry level tier is Bronze, it requires 2,000 points.<br/><br/>Based on the maximum multiplier of 2x for the 365 day staking pool, the minimal number of tokens require is 1,000 $CGPT.</p>"
          },
          {
            "question": "How are Tier Points calculated?",
            "answer": "<p>Tier points are calculated based on two simple factors; the number of tokens staked and the duration of the staking pool they are allocated to.<br/><br/>1 $CGPT = 1 point<br/><br/>45 day = 1 : 1 points, 90 days = 1 : 1.3 points, 180 days = 1 : 1.5 points365 days = 1 : 2 points<br/><br/>So 1,000 $CGPT in 180 day pool would yield 1,500 points.</p>"

            "question": "How many different tiers are there?",
            "answer": "<p>There are four tiers in the launchpad system, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond.

          },
          {
            "question": "What does Allocation Multiplier mean?",
            "answer": "The allocation multiplier specifies the amount of tokens that participants will be able to purchase at the different tier levels. Every tier has its own corresponding allocation multiplier, Bronze: 1, Silver: 4+, Gold: 10+, Diamond 40+."

            "answer": "After submitting an application, they will undergo an initial screening by the ChainGPT Team. Following the screening, projects will be put through an in depth due-diligence process. Only projects that pass the rigorous qualitative assessment are inducted into the incubator and given the rights to list their IDO on the Launchpad."

          {
            "question": "How long is the incubation program?",
            "answer": "Duration of the incubation program depends on the individual needs of a project; averaging around 12 months but can be as long as 18–24 months."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is incubation necessary or can we just apply to IDO?",
            "answer": "Projects are not required to be incubated in order to apply for an IDO listing. However, if a project decides to go through the incubation program then they must IDO via the ChainGPT Pad."

          {
            "question": "What is the max cap on what projects can raise during IDO?",
            "answer": "There is so set maximum. The capacity is based on a project-to-project basis. A multitude of factors will be taken into account, which help gauge potential outcomes, whenever the fundraising goals are being set, which will dictate the maximum capacity."
