            "question": "How is pool weight calculated?",
            "answer": "<p>Pool weight is calculated based on the distribution of tier points among participating members and their corresponding tier levels.<br/><br/>Every pool has a structured base range that is dependent on their staking tier points.<br/><br/>Ape | 1x | 2,000 points — 19,999 points Chad | 4x — 9.99x | 20,000 points — 49,999 points Shark | 10x — 39.99x | 50,000 points — 199,999 points Whale | 40x + | 200,000 points +<br/><br/>The pool weight indicates how much multiplier is applied to that specific teir level’s allocation capacity.<br/><br/>Ape maintains a base level of 1x multiplier throughout its entire point range. The Chad, Shark, and Whale levels pool weights are scaled proportionally to the individual stakers point position within its range. To best understand the mechanism is through an empirical example:<br/><br/>In the event of a Chad tier with 20,000 points, they have a 4x multiplier. In the event of a Chad tier with 35,000 points, they have a 7x multiplier. In the event of a Chad tier with 49,999 points, they have a 9.99x multiplier.<br/><br/>This logic applies to the Shark tier equally.<br/><br/>Given that Whale level can theoretically have no point limit, the cap on the multiplier for them is logarithmically relational to the total IDO’s upper bound.</p>",

Know your Customer (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy ChainGPT Pad is a permissionless, fully decentralized platform for token sales, swaps, and decentralized exchange. As a software development company, ChainGPT Pad has no role in enforcing KYC by default, however, we do provide such tools for fundraising entities using ChainGPT Pad to enforce on their users, if the entities choose to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on ChainGPT Pad by fundraising entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities. Although ChainGPT Pad makes no warranty as to the merit, legality, or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of ChainGPT Pad, we nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require KYC/AML on their token sale participants. Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities and/or competent regulatory authorities, ChainGPT Pad reserves the right at any time: To ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User. To restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined. To share submitted KYC information and documentation to 3rd parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and the end-user (you) agrees to this by using the Service. To confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary. 6.
